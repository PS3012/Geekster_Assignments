              Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to
              provide complete beginners to web development with fundamental
              skills for coding websites.

              The aim is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to take

              If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging
              â€” we will hold your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel
              comfortable and learn the topics properly. You should feel at home
              whether you are a student learning web development (on your own or
              as part of a class), a teacher looking for class materials, a
              hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how
              web technologies work.
